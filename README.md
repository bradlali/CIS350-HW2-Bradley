###My interests:
- Swimming: I was a competitive swimmer up until college, and then I coached a local age group team for a few years.
- Engineering: I am a Computer Engineering major and I'm interested in microcontroller development and applications.
- Reading: I have banned myself from reading during any semester because I will put off important tasks such as homework or sleeping in favor of reading a good book. I prefer the fantasy genre, with my current favorite series being _Throne of Glass_.


##Technical Background:
I believe I was first introduced to coding in middle school, where we were told to go to a website and play around. This website (to my memory) click-and-drag, block style coding for little things such as games middle schoolers might enjoy. Then my junior year of high school I took intro to computer science, followed by AP computer science my senior year. In those courses we covered a variety of things from computer basics (binary, logic, etc) to Java and HTML. After high school, I continued my education first at GRCC-- where I was introduced to MATLAB -- then at GVSU as a Computer Engineering major. My first semester at GV included a class on C programming, and nearly every semester since has used that C programming knowledge to program various microcontrollers. I also learned a hardware based programming language in a class I would rather forget, and of course Python in the computer science classes I've taken in the last year or so.
